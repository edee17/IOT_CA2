## Section 1 Overview of SmartPark

### A. What is SmartCCTV about?

This application is inspired by an incident that happened to my uncle’s 2 Year Old child while he was in his room at Level 2 and my Uncle was at the Living Room which is at Level 1. So my uncle’s house is somewhat of a Smart Home where Lights are controlled by Motion Sensor but one day, while my uncle was at the Living Room, he heard a loud thud sound coming from Level 2 and to his horror, his baby was lying on the floor crying. So, this inspired me to create this application called ‘Smart CCTV’ where you can monitor the Temperature and Humidity of the room, Take a Photo of the room regularly and also sense if the Lighting is too dark or too bright.

### B. How does the final RPI set-up looks like?
